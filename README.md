# CS262_Project2

This is a project to fulfill the requirements of the second design challenges of CS262: Distributed Computing. This README covers to install, setup, run, and test our code. The DesignDecisions doc details our engineering decisions.

## Setup

1. Install the necessary libraries: `pip install asyncio`.

## Running

This is all meant to be run on one physical machine. If you wanted to run this across multiple machines, you would have to modify the config.py file to the intended server host.

1. In one terminal shell, run: `python machine_1.py`
2. In another terminal shell, run: `python machine_2.py`
3. In another terminal shell, run: `python machine_3.py`
4. Watch and observe.

## Testing
